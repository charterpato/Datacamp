# ===== 1. FILTERING AND TARGETING DATA =====

# ----- Connecting to a PostgreSQL Database -----

# Import create_engine function
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine to the census database
engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://student:datacamp@postgresql.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/census')

# Use the .table_names() method on the engine to print the table names
print(engine.table_names())

# ----- Filter data selected from a Table - Simple -----

# Create a select query: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Add a where clause to filter the results to only those for New York
stmt = stmt.where(census.columns.state == 'New York')

# Execute the query to retrieve all the data returned: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Loop over the results and print the age, sex, and pop2008
for result in results:
    print(result.age, result.sex, result.pop2008)

# ----- Filter data selected from a Table - Expressions -----

# Create a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to match all the states in_ the list states
stmt = stmt.where(census.columns.state.in_(states))

# Loop over the ResultProxy and print the state and its population in 2000
for result in connection.execute(stmt).fetchall():
    print(result.state, result.pop2000)

# ----- Filter data selected from a Table - Advanced -----

# Import and_
from sqlalchemy import and_

# Build a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to select only non-male records from California using and_
stmt = stmt.where(
    # The state of California with a non-male sex
    and_(census.columns.state == 'California',
         census.columns.sex != 'M'
         )
)

# Loop over the ResultProxy printing the age and sex
for result in connection.execute(stmt).fetchall():
    print(result.age, result.sex)
